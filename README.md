# Joint-Model-Tutorial
This repository allows you to estimate all the models discussed in :
> Joint Modeling Tutorial - Application of neo-aortic root dilatation after arterial switch operation. Baart et al.

The repository consists of R code for the analysis and a fictive data set.
 
 ## How to run the analyses from the tutorial
Download the `data.RData` file and save it on you computer.

Run the code `Analyses-JM-Tutorial.R` to perform the following analysis on this data set:

1) Time-dependent Cox model
2) Basic joint model
3) Basic joint model - accounting for interval censored data
4) Joint model with additional slope parametrization
5) Multivariate joint model with two longitudinal outcomes (y and y2)
6) Dynamic predictions based on model 2
